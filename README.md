## What is Tranaland?
Tranaland is a virtual country that exists in the minds of its citizens, AKA trans people. It is a place where every trans person (non-binary included) is welcome, and everyone is free to be themselves.
It is freely inspired on Tanaland, a virtual country created for a similar purpose, but for women in general.

It is widely understood that citizens of Tranaland can also be citizens of Tanaland, and vice versa. The two countries are not mutually exclusive.

The original video, in french, can be found [on tiktok](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGd1S6G2q/). With the reason why the flag changed from the original one, on [this video](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGd1ShBte/).
Basically, the original flag had a wide white stripe in the middle, which is used by "MAPs", AKA child molesters, to identify themselves. I didn't know that when I created the flag, but I changed it as soon as I learned about it, not wanting to be associated with such people.

### Trans men and Non-binary people
As previously stated, Tranaland is a place where **every** trans person is welcome, therefore trans men and non-binary people are also citizens of Tranaland. I thought it came without saying, but I've seen some people asking about it, so here it is.

### How to become a citizen?
To become a citizen of Tranaland, you just need to be trans. That's it. You don't need to do anything else. You don't need to apply for citizenship, you don't need to pay any fees, you don't need to pass any tests. You just need to be trans.

### Why the shark/Bl√•haj?
The shark is a reference to the IKEA Bl√•haj shark plushie, which has become a symbol in the trans community. [Click here if you want to know more on that](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTQ_symbols#Bl%C3%A5haj).

### How can I technically modify the flag?
The flag is a simple SVG file, so you can open it with any text editor and modify it as you wish. If you want to use a graphical editor, I recommend [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), which is free and open-source. You can also use any other graphical editor that supports SVG files.

To make the tiktok/smartphone (9/16), simply crop the flag 275px from the left and resize it to 450px wide. On GIMP: Open the flag, leave default rendering of SVG file, go to Image > Canvas Size, set **Width** to 450px and the **Offset X** to -275px, then click on Resize, you can then export the image as a PNG file.
